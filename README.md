# WhoCo Takehome


Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the graph.ql and docker stuff running as my home computer's windows version is too old. I was able to create a quick express server to mimic some of the 
endpoints needed for this application.  You can find the express server under the 'server' directory.

# To Start the front-end Angular server
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

# To Start the back end express server
cd server
npm start

## URLs
Angular Application: http://localhost:4200/
Server application : http://localhost:8081/api/groups
